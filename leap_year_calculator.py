#simple code to practice nested if statements

# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

# on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 

# **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 

# **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400



# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
